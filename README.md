Dual-Brain Quantum-Inspired Financial Analyst AI (Research)

Overview

This repository explores a dual-brain, quantum-inspired AI architecture for financial analysis, market reasoning, and adaptive decision-making. The system is designed to model complementary cognitive modes—analogous to left/right hemispheric processing—combined with probabilistic, quantum-inspired representations of uncertainty, regime shifts, and market dynamics.

The project is research-oriented, experimental, and not intended for live trading or financial advice.

Core Concepts

1. Dual-Brain Architecture

Analytical Brain (Left-Mode)

Deterministic reasoning

Statistical analysis

Indicators, fundamentals, macro data

Risk metrics and constraints


Intuitive Brain (Right-Mode)

Probabilistic inference

Pattern emergence & regime detection

Scenario superposition

Narrative and sentiment abstraction



The two modes operate independently and then reconcile through a decision arbitration layer.


---

2. Quantum-Inspired Modeling (Not Quantum Hardware) This system uses quantum-inspired mathematical concepts, not actual quantum computation:

State vectors for market regimes

Probability amplitudes instead of point estimates

Superposition of competing hypotheses

Interference effects for signal conflict

Collapse mechanisms triggered by new information



---

3. Financial Intelligence Goals

Multi-timeframe market interpretation

Regime shift detection (risk-on / risk-off)

Volatility-aware reasoning

Adaptive confidence scoring

Explainable AI outputs (human-readable rationale)
